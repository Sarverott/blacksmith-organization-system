###### Source problems that makes me able to think it's more than possible

The basic idea was to automate repository controll and make order in project folders for better workspaces' view and controll with easier projects and publication management. Basic idea was work well and just methods of workshop dirtree was big success in local workspace area. Problem appears when new workspaces joins area of my operations and variantogeddon from desynchronization of version grows to uncontrollable sizes. Next issues become visible, after attempts to maintain speed of commiting and supporting publications boundles in thesame time, using conventional methods. But this was only beginning...
